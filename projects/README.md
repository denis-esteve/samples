# Decision services files

This directory contains sample decision services in compressed files available for the 20.0.3.x version of Automation Decision Services. Those are not compatible with version 20.0.2.X.  You import these files into Decision Designer, which points directly to this directory (see [Importing decision projects](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYHZ8_20.0.x/com.ibm.dba.aid/topics/tsk_import_projects.html)).
